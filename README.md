# RISC-V_DDCA
A System Verilog RISC-V processor implementation.

The implementation of the project is guided by the book "Sarah Harris, David
Harris - Digital Design and Computer Architecture_ RISC-V Edition-Morgan Kaufmann
(2021)".Furthermore, the repository follows a similar structure to that described
in Chapter 7 of the book.

The book website http://pages.hmc.edu/harris/ddca/ddcarv.html contains the following
resources:
- HDL: VHDL, SV, V
- Lab exercise and solutions.
- Video tutorials
